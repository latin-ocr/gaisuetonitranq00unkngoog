in part The lives of Vergil and Persius are believed to be
the work oi another hand. From the book De Historicis,
fragments of the life oi Pliny the Elder exist. Of the
work De &ammalario et Rhetorihus, the greater part, together
with the index, is extant. The life oi Terence has been pre-
served entire by Donatus, in the introduction to his com-
mentary onTerence. The life of Horace was preserved in
manuscripts of his works, and at an early date was prefixed
in somewhat modified form to copies of his peems. The
life ol Persius is attributed to Valerius Probus.

The work De Vita Caesarum, dedicated to C. Septicius
Clarus, was published in 120 an. This work was divided
into eight books, in such away that the lives of the first
six emperors, from Julius to Nero, form one book each;
those of the three emperors ofthe year 69, the seventh3 and

· those of the three Flavians, the eighth. The beginning oi
the life of J nlius is missing.

Δ musculus OF SUETONIUS.¹

But few oi the numerous manuscripts oi Suetonius found
in the various librarios of Europe are of any great velue.
These manuscripts may be divided on the basis of their origin
into four classes, ta the first of which belongs the Oodca
Memmianas, the oldest end most valuable, and the Gudianus.
The second class has as its type the third Mcdiceaa, and in-
cludes the Oodea Vaticanus of Lipsius. Becker also places
the Berolini, No. 337, one of the best of the inferior manu·

10fisoth’spretsce. Forpoints on textual criticism, eonsuh Becker,
quaestiones Uatiena. For some of the latest work done in collating
manuscripts, see Harnard Sindica in Classical Philolaus, Vol. XII,
pp. le-se.
