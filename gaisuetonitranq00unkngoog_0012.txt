at Baiae tc rival a similar structure cf Xerxes over the
Hellespont, he goes cn tc say that, when a bcy, he had
heard his grandfather give a different orrplanation.l lua
passage oi the De Grammaticia¹ he states that he recalls
from the period oi his youth the system cf declamation and
disputation employed by the rhetorieian Princeps. Suetonius
probably spent his early years at Rome, for, in speaking cf
the cruelty of Domitian, he' remarks that he himself, when
a youth, was present (le. in Rome) on one occasion, when
an investigaticn was being made to determine whether a
certain aged man was a ,J ew.³ Another personal reference
is met with in the statement that during his youth, twenty
years after the death of Nero (te. after the year 88 and be·
iore the death of Vologesus in 91), a pseudoNero had great

influence at the court oi the Parthians*
The letters of Pliny the Ycunger throw some light upon
the life cf Suetonius between the years 96 and 112 or
thereabout. The first nine books oi these let

{3232 ters were written after the death of Domitian,

and before Pliny was appointed governor oi

Bithynia and Pontus. The tenth contains the official cor·
respondence that passed between Trajan and Pliny, his
representative, chiefly in regard to the administration cf
the province. The earliest of these letters addressed to
Suetonius shows that the latter was about twenty-six years
of age at the time, while the latest attests that he was not

far from iorty.
