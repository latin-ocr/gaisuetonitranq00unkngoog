2⁵. inlatum deinde Augusti mummium: Suetonius, Aue. 101,
gives an extended ιιιοιιι oi this will. Tiberius and Livia ere made
heirs Legacies ιο his relatives and friends, ιο ιιι Roman people,
legions, praetorian soldiers sud cohorte, are enumerated. The will
alsostatee that many oi the legaeies leitto Augustus bad been expended
by him in the interests oi ιιι state. It is forbidden that ιιι two J ullas,
his daughter and grenddaughter, be buried in his tomb. Os. DIo, ivi.
32 ; Tacitus, Anu. i. 8, “ At the first session oi the senate, he allowed
nothing ιο ιι discussed but ιιι iuneral ceremonles oi Augustus. 'l'be
will wss brought ln by the Vestsls‚ sud it was found thet Tiberius and
Livia were appointed his heirs.‘’

26. signatoribus . . . agnoscentibus: it wss customary ior the
witnesses both to sign aud place their seels upon awlll. The soal
and signatore were placed upon the outside oi the document

30. ex parte dimidia etsextantezi†1²‚={; bereseaebesse
might have been used to express ‘heir ιο two-thirds oi ιιι estete)
Since the Romans used a duodechnal system in expressing their irac-
tions‚ the as being the unit, ιιι shores into which an inheritanoe was
divided was expressed in tweliths; ep. iteres es osse, ‘heir ιο the
whole'3 exsemine, ‘to one-bali'; ss triente, ‘to one-third‚’ ete.

Pege 16. 3. principatum: tite suspire; lit ‘the principuus? the
word used to signiiy the rule oi the princeps, which last title best
expresses ιιι position oi the emperor, ae head oi the government and
the people. The words imperium and imperator always retain some-
thing oi their technioal-military meaning, as ln ιιι passage irem Taci-
tus cited next. quamvls . . . dubitasset: see Introd. ΙΙ. 5 3, b
(5). Os. Tacitus, Ans. l. 7, who states that on Augustus’ death,
rliberius, as their imperator, gave the watchword to ιιι praetorians;
thet armed girarde surroundeei ιιι psiace aud accompanied him into
the Forum and Curia3 and that there were all other indicatione oi sn
imperial court. In ieet, that ιι shewed hesitation in nothing, except
when addressing the senate. Velleius’ view, ii. 124, is different. ile
represents that there was a veriteble contest between Tiberius and the
state, the latter endeavorlng ιο prevsil upon him to become its prince,
and ιι struggling to remein in s private station.

4. emtione miiitum: this reiers to the excubiae, or detail oi pree-
teriens, οι guard at the palace. Roth's text reads et statione militum.

tition oi the last syllable oi the preceding verb.

6. impudentissimo mimo: with tite most buresaeed hypocrite.
