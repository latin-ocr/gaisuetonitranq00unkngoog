Tiberius was the heir of Augustus, but the latter did not have the
right ιο bequeath his power as princeps. The ex-Empress Livia,
because of her native ability and her exaited position (she had been
adopted by Augustus iu his will, and had received the name Julia aud
the title Augusta), had a large following ol devoted friends. German-
icus, more closely related ιο Augustus than Tiberius and dearly loved
by his soldiers, might have been a dangcrous rival had he so willed.
These facts made Tiberius cautious, and only gradually did he assume
complete control of the governmeut. The death of Germanicus in
the East, removing, as it did, apossihle rival, was generally attributed
ιο poison administered by Piso at the instigationes Tiberius. Of this, ,
however, there is absolutely no proof. Early in the reign, the election
of magistrates passed from the comitia ιο the senate. This body
Tiberius treamd vvith studied respect. Many oi its members, however,
he viewed with suspicion, and a wider application was given ιο the
law of treascu, resultlug in the growth oi an infamous class of pro·
fessional informare. Of great significance was the concentration in
a permanent camp at Rome of the praetorian cohorte. Their com-
mender, Sejanus, became the most powerful official under the emperor.
On the fall of Sejanus, Macro succeeded as praefectus praetorio. The
prolonged absence ol Tiberius from Rome resulted in making his
representative in the city (the praefectus arbi) spermanent official.
Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio Cassius agree in picturing Tiberius as
a man of gloom and suspicion, who finally degenerated into a blood-O
thirsty tyrant. Velleius, who treats oi the period before Tiberius'
accession and the early years of his principato, writes in a style so
laudatory that he excites suspicion as ιο his sincerity. Tacitus is
unjust, in that he attributes ιο Tiberius those motives that best
support his own theory, which was that Tiberius was a hypocrite dur-
ing ell his earlier years, and only in the latter portion of his lifa
shewed his true colors All three note a change scr the worse in
