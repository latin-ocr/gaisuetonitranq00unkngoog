Gaetulicus in 39 aa: “Gaius ordered Lentulus Gaetulicus put to
death; he was a man cf distinction and had been governor of Ger-
many ior ten years. The charge was that he had endeavored ιο curry
favor with the army.” Dic then goes on ιο say that Lepidus, who
had been on very intimate terme with Caligula, by whom he had
been selected as his successor to the throne, was also put ιο death.
Tlrereupon Caligula granted a largess ιο the army, “as though he
had triumphed over the enemy.'‘ Dio evidently does not believe in
the truth oi these charges, ior he continues, “ Gaius wrote and sent
to the senate an account oi thess matters, as though hs had escaped ¹
from plots against his liie. On other occasions, too, he was wont to
ieign that his life was passed amid great dangers.‘’
