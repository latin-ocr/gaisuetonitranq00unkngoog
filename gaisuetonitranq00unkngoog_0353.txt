Pege 126. 4. perdere statuit: xiphilin, lxi. 12, says that it was '
asserted on good authority, that Seneca was the prime mover in this
crime. Tacitus, Ante. xiv. 7, simply states that aiter her death Nero
summoned Seneca and Burrus, either as his confederates or to test
their feelings on what he had done without their knowledge. ter
veneno temptasset: Tacitus, Ana. xiv. 3, says nothing about these
three attempta. He states that Nero first decided upon poison, but

Tacitus, Aua. xiv. ’4, says that coming from Antium she was met by
Nero, and conducted to Bauli. Her suspicions aroused, she travelled
by sedan cheir to Baiae, where the banquet took place. This does
not contradict Suetonius. in locum. . . illud: the galley in
