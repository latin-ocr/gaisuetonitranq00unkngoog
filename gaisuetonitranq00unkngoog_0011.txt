Imrn most 6113116 writers oi the Silver Age, Gaius Suetonius
Tranquillus is exceedingly reticent as to his early liie. He
states, however, that his father, Suetonius Laetus,¹ a military
tribune, took part in 13116 battle of Bedriacum,¹
which was fought in the year 69 um. Το this
meagre information with regard to his family,
Suetonius' contemporaries add nothing. Not even the place
of his birth is mentioned. Vossius, a Dutch scholar oi the
seventeenth century, suggests⁸ that 116 wasa 1161116 61
cisalpine Gaul, but adduces nothing more convincing to
support this theory than the fact that Suetonius' friend,
Pliny the Younger, was a native of that region. The year
oi his birth, while quite uncertain, cannot be assigned to a
later date than 75 an, as may be inferred from a passage
cited later, in which he speaks of a pseudoNero at the court
oi Vologesus.

- A few personal references relating to the periodos his
youth are found in his writings. For example,
in his life of Caligula, after stating the gener-
ally accepted theory that the emperor had built his bridge
