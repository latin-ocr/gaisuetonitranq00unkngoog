Β. tenax: this is contradicted by the statements oi Tacitus and
Velleius l'aterculus. The former, Ana. l. 75, states that Tiberius was
always ready to pay out money for honorabis proJects a virtue he re-
tained aiter losiug all otbers3 and again, iii. 18, he terms him, satis
firmus adversum pecuniam. The latter, ii. 130, says that he assisted
many with his own private means, especially at the time that the
. Caellan hill was ravaged by fire. Dio, lvii. 10, aiter enumeratlng

that be did complete these two works, but only these, and that be left
them undedioated, either because oi his advanced age, or because he
scorned display. Dio, lvii. 10, states that his only new work was the
temple of Angustus; and this is probably correct, as it was only the
stage oi Pompey’stheatre that Tiberius reconstructed. lt is believed
that the temple oi Angustus stood on the side oi the Palatino facing
the Capitol. Pompey‘s theatre was built in 55 a.c., and was the first
permanent theatre at Rome. ’
