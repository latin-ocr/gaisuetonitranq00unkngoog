cause they had crncified some Romans, and Tacitus, Ann xii. 58, is
authority ior the statement that they had been often deprived oi their

probably due ιο contentione between the Jews and christinus, ior the
Romans regarded the latter simply as a sect oi the former. By the
name Obrestus, Suetonius probably refers to Christ, who irom'the Ro-

The Romans ielt nothing but contempt ior the Jews, and it is con·
ceivable that Suetonius, though he had heard oi Christ, was not aware
that he had been executed in the reign oi Tiberius and that he had
never been at Rome. Both Tertullian, Apol. 3, and Lactantius, In-
stit. iv. 7. i, testiiy that the Romans, in their ignorance, used the iorms
Chrestus and Chrestiani. Dio, lx. 6, states that Claudius, finding the
number oi Jews at Rome so great that they could not be expelled
without causing tumults, simply iorbade those who observed the
Jewish rites meeting together. Dio probably refers to the Christiane
as well as the Jews, ior he never uses the former name. Os. Orosius,
vii. 6. 16, who quotes these words oi Suetonius aud thus comments
upon them: quod utrum contra Christum tumultuantes Iurioeos
