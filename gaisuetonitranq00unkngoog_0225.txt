Paga 22. 1. Aegyptios Iudaicosque ritus compescuit: Tacitus,
Ana. ii. 85 (19 aa), is not much more explicit. He states, however,
thet tour thousand treedmen were expelled ιο Sardinia, charged with
being disoiples oi these culte. From losephus, Aret. Jad. xviil. 3, 4, we
lsarn the circumstances. The temple oi Isis was destroyed and its
priests were emeliled by Tiberius, because ot an outrage perpetrated
by a ltoman knight upon a woman of rank in this temple, with the
assistance oi the priests. The Jews were punished because four ol
that sect had persuaded one oi their proselytos, anoble Roman lady,
to send as gitta ιο tho temple ot Jerusalem sums which they had
stolen. In general, it may be said that the Romans 'were very tolerant
toward foreign eults. They were aggressively hostile only toward

ing tandency and hostile to the etate religion, or toward those which,
like Druidism, fostered national sentlments detrimental to Roman
