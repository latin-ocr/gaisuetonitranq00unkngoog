xx INTRODUCTION. 111.

o. Tamquam and quusi are sometimes used, as in TacitnS,
introducing a subjunctive clause where the accusative with
infinitive might have been expected:

acerque opinio tamquam et nctus ibi sit, Aay. 6; increbrescente
rumore quasi . .. commoraretur, Tib. 11.

d. Et with the force of ettam is very common.

e. Quo is used to introduce a clause of purpose where no
comparison is involved:

quo. . . subduceret, rm. 22.

f. Donec is used with the subjunctive in a statement of
fact.

Viewed as awhole, the Latin of Suetonius is not so closely
modelled on the Ciceronian style as that of Quintilian or
that of Pliny the Younger‚ nor does it exhibit such rnarked
peculiarities of the Silver Age as do the diction of Seneca
and Tacitus. It does not present many difficulties, and is
admirably adapted to the purpose of its author.

III.
THE wousss OF sterculus.

Some oi the works of Suetonius were written in Greek,
others in Latin, a practice followed by many of the authors
of the time. ,

With the exception oi the Lines of the caesare, but few
fragments, considering the bulk of his productioris, have
come down to ns, and considerable doubt exists even in
regard to the titles of many of the works.

The first collection of the fragments¹ was made by Isaac

¹The standard edition of the fragments is Reifferscheid’s‚ which
may be consulted ior further infor-marion with reference to them.
