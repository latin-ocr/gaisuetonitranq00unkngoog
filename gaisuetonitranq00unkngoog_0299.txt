- 15. diaetam: diceto (lit. ‘a place lor living‘) does not siguliy
any definite kind oi room. lt means, in different connectione, a
sloeping room, a dining room, a summer house, or even a suite of
apartments. It means here one ci Claudius' roome ln the palsce.

16. Hermaeum: perhaps so named irem a statue ln the apart-
ment

1⁷. solarium: the diceto probably opened on eportion oi the root
oi the palare used as ο terrace (solarium). The doorway or ewiuging
window leading to this terrace was draped with a curtain. The word
solanum is also, in Nero, chap. 16. 29, used ιο signiiy the roois oi
porticoes. The account oi the discovery ci Claudius is very much
the same in both hio, lx. l, and Josephus, Ant. lad. xlx. 3. The
account oi the latter is, however, much more detailed. They both say
that Claudius was iound hiding in a dark corner. inceptus gives the
name Gratus to the soldier who discovered him.

19. estudlo sciscitandi . . . adgnovit: us ο result os hie
desire toflnd out who it was (he loclced) and recognized him. The
soldier, irom seeing the ieet oi Claudius, knew that some one was
trying to hide, and his curiosity was aroused. Inasmuch ,as the
expression e studio sciscitandi. . . adgnovit, ‘from the desire oi
finding out , . . he recognized’ is not strictly logical, Madvig sus-
pects that the word adgnovit has crept into the text, end emenda to
read studio sciscitandi quonam esset, etc, salutavit. The expression
can hardly be misunderstood, however, and is used ior the sake oi
hrevity.

22. fluctuem nec quicquam, etc: ο prey to uncencinty, und
aa yet doing nothing but picino ceretto their rape.
