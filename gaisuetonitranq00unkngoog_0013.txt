In these letters Pliny shows that he held the character of
his friend in high esteem‚ and that he was solicitous for his
welfare. It was through Pliny's influence that the office of
military tribune was offered to Suetonius. This office, since
he did not care to accept it, he had transferred to a friend-
again through the kindness oi Pliny.l Pliny also inter-'
cedcd in behali of Suetonius with reference to the purchase
of a pieoe oi property‚¹ and goes 6ο far as to style him
“mutaberuolis meas.'' When Suetonius was about to plead
scaea, and was much perturbcd in consequence of a dream,
it was Pliny who consoled and calmed him, and even
promised to secure a postponement of the trial.⁸ It was
Pliny, too, who encouraged him to put the finishing touches
to some of his writings and publish them.⁴ Finelly, in
soliciting from the Emperor Trajan the bencfits of the ias
triam liberorum for Suetonius, he remarked that the longer
he knew him the more highly he prized him.⁶ All this
from a man oi Pliny's refinement and judgment argues for
the good qualities oi Suetonius.

Though Suetonius was a lawyer, and filled some public
poste during his life, yet he seemed hy nature suited to more
tranquil paths. He was in truth, ae Pliny says,
aocholrraticus.⁰ At Pliny's death, a dear friend ⁸3⁰⁰& ”⁸
of Pliny's‚ Gaius Septicius Clarus,l became⁸ ω
Suetonius' patron. To this Septicius he dedicated his eight
boolrs on the lives of the Caesare, audit was through Septi·
cius’ influence that he was appointed secretary to Hadrian.

as Septicius and others, afterward lost favor. Spartianus⁰
