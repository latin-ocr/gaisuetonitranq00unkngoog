Agrippina bad poisoned Claudius soon after she bad prevailed upon
him to disregard bis own son Britannicus and to adopt her son Neri».
The latter was immediately proclsimed emperor by tbe praetoriana.
At first Nero allowed affairs to be managed by his imperious mother,
by Seneca, bis tutor, and by Burrus, the praefect of the guarda.
During these years the finauoes were well managed, tbe senate treated
with consideration, and administrativa reforma instituted. After tbe
murder of Agrippina, the death of Burrus, and tbe retirement of Sen-
eca, Nero fell under the influence of Tigellinus, his praefectus prce·
toric, and of his freedmen. The treasury was depleted, the coinage
debased, and tbe senate disregarded. The city was laid waste hya
conflagration, which popular rumor attributed to Nero. The Chris-
tians, whose name now first appears in history, were charged with
the deed by Nero, and prosecuted.

In the suppression of the conspiracy of Piso, many eminent men
perished, notably Seneca and Lucan. Owing to the widespread dis-
content, Vindex, governor of Gaul, revolted, and was J'oined by Galba,
governor of Lusitania. Verginius Rufus, with the legions of Upper
Germany, defeated Vindex, but the victorious troops themselves turned
against Nero. Amid these disturbances he fell by his own band.
