anaor seit . . . staura aerari a quaestoribus urbanis ad praetorios
praetoresve transiret During the republic quaestore had charge oi the
public uemury Two aediles were given temporary charge by Caesar.
The different changes irom that time arc stated by Tacitus, Ana. xiii.
29. Augustas ilrst allowed the senate to choose praeiects oi the treas-
ury. As intrlguc was employed ln their selection, they were aiter·
ward drawn by lot iram the praetore This oiten resulted in the
appointment oi incompetens men, so that Claudius restored the quaes
tons. The quaestors lacked experience, however, and Nero chose such
as had pamcd the praetorship and were oi tried ability.

³2. praetura iuncti: the expression praetura, consulatu, eta,
sancti is often used in the imperial period to distinguish those who
had actually held an office irom those who had simply had the title, a
distinction not expressed by the words praetorii, maculares, eta.

Paga 93. 1. ornamenta Sileno, eta .· Claudius had done all that
he could to make the man popular ; cs. Tac. Ana. xii 3. tiliae:
Octavia Fumeaux refers the conferring oi the honorary triumph to
the year 44 ιιι, considering Suetoniua' statement, nondumpotest,
an exaggeration. Ilio, lx. 31, however, corroborares Suetonius.

2. umoribus vcro natu tam multis: os. Dio, ln 23: “He not
only bestowed the insignia triumphalia upon the consulars who had
served in the campaign in Britain, but upon senators as well ; he was
accustomed, in iact, to hestow this honor lavishly, ior the most trivial
achievements.”

4. utlagatis comuladbus, cta: Tacitus’ explanation (Aac. xi.
20) oi this request is, that generals who did not have the opportunity
oigaining this distinctionin war tried tosecureitin other ways, digging
canals, working mines, eto, and thus wore ont their soldiers by hard
labor.
