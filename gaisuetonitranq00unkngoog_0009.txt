PREFAOE.

Tun Licea cf the Caesare contained in this collection are
of great interest to the student of Roman history, since
they treat cf the period covered by the Annulo of Tacitus,
by which they are so admirably illustrated and the gaps
of which they serve to bridge. The Licea are, too, in
special need of elucidation, partly because of their authors
disregard of chronological sequence and partly because of
their extreme conciseness. The Notes cf this edition, there
fore, have been made rather full, with a view to confirm,
refuta, or further illustrate the statements of Suetonius
by citatione from other authors, especially from Tacitus,
Dio Cassius, and the latter's abridger, Xiphilin.

No commentary on the Lives of this edition has, so far
as Iam aware, been published in any modern language.
The old commentatore, and the Banmgarten-Crusius-Hase
edition in particular, have been of assistance in preparing
the Notes3 but of necessity, in an edition of this kind, much
of the work has beendone independently. The text adopted λ
is that of Roth (1857), with modificaticns.

Ι wish to express my great indebtedness to Professor
Oharles E. Bennett and Professor John C. Rclfe for their
many valuable suggestions. Ialso appreciata the assistance
given me by my colleague‚ Dr. John E. Granrnd, who read
critically the proof of the commentary.
