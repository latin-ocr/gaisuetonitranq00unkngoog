Suetonius of necessity reflecte the literary tendencies of
his time; yet his style is less typical of the Silver Age than
that of any other writer of the period. His use of Greek
words and poetical phrases and constructione seems to be
due to the influence of the age rather than to his personal
inclination. He airus at olearness, simplieity, and brevity,
though on occasions condensation is attained at the expense
of clearness. The brevity oi Suetonius’ diction is not epi·
grammatic, nor employed with erident artistic purpose. It
is the brevity of economy, which aims to express the thought
in the simplest and fewest words. N eglect of concinnity and
parallelism of construction, while not carried toercess as in
Tacitus, are peculiarities of Suetonius’ style. The sentences
are comparatively short, and there is an entire absence of
the periodie structure. As would he expected from these
truite, his prose is not harmonious. In fact, he seems to be
utterly lacking in a feeling for rhythm. He does not strive
for effect, and his diction is singularly free from rhetorical
ornamentation. He keeps himself entirely out of his works, ,
with the result that his style is somewhat colorless. Its
very simplicity, however, gives an element of strength and
vigor. The following are the most noticeable linguistic
characteristica:
