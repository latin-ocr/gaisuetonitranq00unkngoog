sister oi Alexander. She is everywhere else called Cleopatra, and

3. Enniam: wife oi Macro. See Culiy.chap.12.5; cs. Dio, lix.
10: ‘⁶ Gaius, iorgetting the love oi Ennia aud the benefits conferred
upon him by Macro, although he had obtained much thereby, even
empire itseli, drove thern to death.’'

6. nihilo reverentior, etc: Dio, lix. 23, states that Gaius did not
wish it ιο appear that the senate had any power to confer honors upon
himself, and hence he treated that body with studied contempt.

sul, aiter having compelled the regular consulsto resign because they
had not proclairned holidays in honor oi his birthday.

cates that they wished tc be beiorehand in securing desirable places.

2³. decimae: it is not easy to explain the meaning oi desiccas in
this passage. The decimo was originally the tithe offered a deity.
Afterward it would seem ιο have acquired the meaning oi gift or
offering to the people, and probably refers here ιο the censitio, men-
tioued in note on p. 52. ll. The meaning oi the passage, then, is that
Caligula, before the orders had taken their places in the theatre, began
to distribute his gratuities. The mcb took possession of the most ad-
vantageous places ior securiug thern, which Caligula had arranged to
be the places reserved ior the equites.

26. velie: great canopies which served to protect the people in the
amphitheatres from the rays oi the sun and from the rain. The hules,
with the stone supporta beneath thern, used to support the masis
which held the canopies, may still be seen on a portion oi the upper
periphery oi the Coliseum. We learn from Pliny, N. H. six, 23,
that the materiai was often linen, and that it was dyed brilliant hues ;
cs. Lucretius, iv 75, and vi. 109. These canopies were usually han·
⁴dled by details oi sailors from the fleet.
