’ 20. Actium manumittere: this is probably the case referred ιο

by llio, lvii. 11, where he states that Tiberius was so fair and Just
that when the people demanded the manumissiones an actor, he
would not permit it until the owner had signified his willingness and
had received his price.

22. nisi unnim . . probassent: Tacitus, Ama i. 75, attributes
this conduct on the part oi Tiberius to his love of severity, which be
displayed even in meritorious actions. Velleius’ explanation (ii. 129)
is more favorablo. He implies that the senate was ssked to psas upon
such cases in the interest oi frugality and economy.

25. auctore Augusto, eta: ie. on the advice oi Augustus, he
married and raised a family. ’

27. proposito milies, eta: offeririp to loca sor tte space os three
years tbe sum os 100,000,000 sesterces without interest; cs. Dio,
lviii. 21. Roth's text reads sestertio, a conjecture of Glareanus
for sestertium of the manuscripts. ln view of tha fact that almost
without exception the manuscripts of Suetonius read sestertium in
passages where the numeral adverb is used, and where the surn
expressed isin the genitive and ablative (passages in Roth always
amended ιο sestertii and sestertio), it seems uruch safer to regard
the numeral as an indeclinable substantive and sestertium as genitive
plural. In the present passage proposito milies is ablative absolute.
It must be acknowIedged, however, that the forms sestertio and
sestertii do occur in such constructions with manuscript authority,
especially in Tacitus. The two constructione probably existed side
by side. See Herenni Stadios in Οἱαοοίοοῑ Philolopy, Vol. vn,
p. 210 seq.

29. qmbusdam domnis, eto. : Tacitus, Ana. iv. 64 (27 sm), tells
how the-people murmured and said that Tiberius had formed the plan
to be absent, knowing it to be a year boding disaster. Their oom-
piaints were sileneed by his generosity. On the occasion of a severe
dre ten years later, Tiberius again cameto the assistance of bis people.
This is passed over in silence by Suetonius. Α corps of vigiles had
been formed in the year 6 an, one of whose duties wasto protect
the city from these frequently recurringconiiagrations. insularum:
insulae was the name given to the compaot blooks, the apartment
houses of the Romam. The detaohed mansion with its grounds was
called dormis.

30. magna difficultate nummaria: this stringency of the year
33 sm. was due to the fact that all debts were called in, as explained
iu note on p. 26. 3.
