28. paegniariis: the text is difficolt here. The reading ls that oi
Roth (he gives the 'contracted form paegniaris, ior pegaares, the read·
ing of the Mammiau manuscript). Pegmares ls that nithe Medicean
ist and 3d. The lacuna before quoque is to he filled by supplying
gladiatoribus, or some word oi similar meaning. Paegaarius (Gr.
παίγνιον, ‘plaything') means ‘pertaining to play.’ The passage
apparently means: ‘He turned wild beasts, all wasted away, against
worthless gladiators worn out by age, and pitted against make-bellete
gladiators householders, respectable, hut noted ior some bodily
defeat) ’
